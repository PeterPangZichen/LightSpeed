## Game Intro
Who has the fastest hand among your friends? Are you stressed with your projects or work recently? Play our Light Speed and relieve your stress. __Light Speed__ is designed for 2 players inspired from classic Strike A Light arcade game. Our game consists of 17 buttons, 8 buttons for each player, and 1 button to start the game. Each game takes 30-seconds, and each player will get 1-point whenever they press a lit button and lose 1-point for pressing a wrong button. The buttons are randomly lit up. The faster the player presses the lit buttons, the higher score he/she can get. All buttons will light up at the winnerâ€™s side at the end of the game.
